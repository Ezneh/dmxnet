### dmxnet is now a D2-only library

As of this release, dmxnet only supports D2 applications.  Its APIs have
not changed, but its code has been converted from D1 to D2, and it will
now only build with a D2 compiler.

In consequence, D2 releases of dmxnet (the only kind from here on out!)
will now simply be tagged `vX.y.z` and not `vX.y.z+d2`.
